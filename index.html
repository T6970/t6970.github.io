  <h2>About</h2>
  This site has aim of:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Security - apart from the server that serves the content, there's no backend to collect your data.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Simplicity - only HTML, CSS and client-side JS are used for this website as well as my other applications.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Self-contained - no external dependencies that can cause bugs or been compromised.
    </li>

      Ugh, broken...JS??? Or you didn't enable it???
      Well, some functions of the site requires it. 
      Don't worry, this is a static server. No backend to scrape your data or do whatever malicious. Anyway, I can't.
      <br>
      JS is needed for:
      <el>
        <li>Footer (this may be strange, but footer is synchronized across pages)</li>
        <li>News ticker (HTML alone can't do that at all)</li>
        <li>Blog (posts are fetched from GitHub Discussions)</li>
      </el>
    </p>
