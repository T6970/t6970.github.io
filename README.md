#### Site under reinnovation (because of minimal dependency movement)
---
This site has aim of:
- **Security**: apart from the server that serves the content, there's no backend to collect your data.
- **Simplicity**: only HTML, CSS and client-side JS are used for this website as well as my other applications.
- **Independency**: no external dependencies that can cause bugs

# Current apps
- **caLib** - cellular automata simulation library written in JavaScript
- **Onlice** - merge of office suites
- **Very Visual SCE** - source code editor with visual twist
