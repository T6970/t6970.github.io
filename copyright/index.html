      Ugh, broken...JS??? Or you didn't enable it???
      Well, some functions of the site requires it. 
      Don't worry, this is a static server. No backend to scrape your data or do whatever malicious. Anyway, I can't.

      JS is needed for:
      <el>
        <li>Footer (this may be strange, but footer is synchronized across pages)</li>
        <li>News ticker (HTML alone can't do that at all)</li>
        <li>Blog (posts are fetched from GitHub Discussions)</li>
      </el>
